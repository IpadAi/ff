   <h1>Fast Fashion</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>See it. Ship it. Try it. Love it. Insta. 
Fast-Fashion moves fast.
Trendy. Harmful. Gratifying. Wasteful. 
Fast Fashion has negative effects.</p>


<p>What is Fast Fashion, you ask? 
Fast Fashion is the fashion trends that don’t last long. Fast Fashion is the process of making clothes cheaper and faster to make. Fast fashion is changing how we shop and how we dress.

25 years ago, people bought half as much and kept clothes for almost twice as long. Fast-forward to today. Now fashion changes almost daily. 
Fashion trends don’t depend on the season anymore.  Now celebrities and influencers make certain fashions popular. 

Fast Fashion creates a huge impact on the environment.  Often the clothes we don’t want end up in a landfill. On average, North Americans are only wearing their newest item of clothing 7 times. This is different than European countries wearing each item of clothing 40 times.
Worldwide, people buy 80 Billion pieces of clothing each year.  That's 400% more than just 20 years ago.
That means we are throwing clothes out faster than ever before.

Every second, the United Nations claims that somewhere around the world a dumpster is dumping a whole truckload of textile waste into a landfill or burned.


But in addition to clothes ending up in landfill, clothing production pollutes our waters with microfibers and dyes.

It takes a lot of resources to make clothes too. 
2700 litres of water to make one cotton t-shirt. That’s equal to what a person drinks in 2.5 years of their life!  

Producing clothes pollutes our air by creating more greenhouse gasses than shipping and aviation combined.


What can we do to help as kids?


Kids can follow the 6 R’s of clothing
Rethink: ask ourselves and our parents if we really need it and how long we plan to wear it.
Reduce: by cutting down the energy it takes to get clothing to you by reducing online shopping
Reuse: try to wear our clothes in different ways by re-styling them
Refuse: Don’t buy materials that are bad for the environment or things we don’t need
Recycle: by asking our parents if we can donate old clothes or being proud to  wear hand-me-dows  
Repair: learn how to sew on buttons and patch little holes in clothes to increase the life of our clothes by many years.


Most importantly we can donate any clean clothes instead of throwing them out even if they are too worn or torn so that they can be recycled.  Donation sites like the Salvation Army do a good job of keeping textiles from landfills by finding ways to recycle them.   The Salvation Army Thrift Store diverted 80 million pounds of textiles away from landfills in 2022.  
What do donation sites like the Salvation Army do with the clothes we donate? They sort all the clothes they get and decide which ones to sell locally at thrift stores.  Approximately 25% of items get sold in thrift stores.
The rest of the 75% either gets sold to East African countries to be sold there or 
Goes into a process called “ragging” where it’s sold to make rags.
If the textile is not good enough for ragging, it can be shredded and used for underpadding for carpets, filling for furniture, insulation for houses or lining the trunks of cars.
All that recycling keeps clothes out of landfills.
So tell your parents to donate everything that’s not dirty or soiled- even if it’s a single sock. Those donated items can be recycled in many different ways to get a second life.</p>




<h2>To beat the pollution of fast fashion, kids need to act fast and do their part too. Let’s all be influencers for the environment so that we can all have a cleaner future.</h2>
